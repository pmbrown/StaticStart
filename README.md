# StaticStart

A Hugo SSG starter template for developers familiar with Hugo, HTML, CSS and Sass, includes the configuration and layouts for a static website built using Hugo, and the source files for a color-schemed startup CSS framework compiled through Hugo using Dart-Sass.

Developing locally requires having Hugo and Dart-Sass installed with both being available on the same path on your computer, the Hugo docs also provides more information about the Sass to CSS function plus details about hosting and deployment.
